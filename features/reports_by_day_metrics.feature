  Background:
    Given private organization Rebel Alliance exists
    And user hsolo who is a member of Rebel Alliance exists
    And user lskywalker who is a member of Rebel Alliance exists
    And project X-Wing exists within organization Rebel Alliance
    And test result report R1 was generated 2 days ago for organization Rebel Alliance
    And test payload payload 1 sent by lskywalker for version 1.0.0 of project X-Wing was used to generate report R1
    And test payload payload 2 sent by hsolo for version 1.0.0 of project X-Wing was used to generate report R1
    And test result report R2 was generated 2 days ago for organization Rebel Alliance
    And test payload payload 3 sent by lskywalker for version 1.0.0 of project X-Wing was used to generate report R2
    And test result report R3 was generated 1 day ago for organization Rebel Alliance
    And test payload payload 4 sent by lskywalker for version 1.0.0 of project X-Wing was used to generate report R3
    And test result report R4 was generated 1 day ago for organization Rebel Alliance
    And test payload payload 5 sent by lskywalker for version 1.0.0 of project X-Wing was used to generate report R4
    And test result report R5 was generated 1 day ago for organization Rebel Alliance
    And test payload payload 6 sent by lskywalker for version 1.0.0 of project X-Wing was used to generate report R5
    And test result report R6 was generated 1 day ago for organization Rebel Alliance
    And test payload payload 7 sent by lskywalker for version 1.0.0 of project X-Wing was used to generate report R6
    And test result report R7 was generated for organization Rebel Alliance
    And test payload payload 8 sent by lskywalker for version 1.0.0 of project X-Wing was used to generate report R7
    And project Y-Wing exists within organization Rebel Alliance
    And test result report R8 was generated 1 day ago for organization Rebel Alliance
    And test payload payload 9 sent by hsolo for version 1.0.0 of project Y-Wing was used to generate report R8
    And test payload payload 10 sent by lskywalker for version 1.0.0 of project Y-Wing was used to generate report R8
    And test result report R9 was generated for organization Rebel Alliance
    And test payload payload 11 sent by hsolo for version 1.0.0 of project Y-Wing was used to generate report R9
    And assuming reports by day metrics are calculated for 3 days by default
